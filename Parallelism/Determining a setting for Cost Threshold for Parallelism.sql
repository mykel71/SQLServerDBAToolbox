-- Determining a setting for Cost Threshold for Parallelism
-- Part of the SQL Server DBA Toolbox at https://github.com/DavidSchanzer/Sql-Server-DBA-Toolbox
-- This script uses another method to attempt to calculate an appropriate value for Cost Threshold for Parallelism
-- From http://sqlknowitall.com/determining-a-setting-for-cost-threshold-for-parallelism/
--
-- "So what do I do with these numbers? In my case, I am trying to get “about” 50% of the queries below the threshold and 50% above.
-- This way, I split the amount of queries using parallelism. This is not going to guarantee me the best performance, but I figured 
-- it was the best objective way to come up with a good starting point.
--
-- If all of my statistics are very close, I just set the Cost Threshold for Parallelism equal to about what that number is. 
-- An average of the 3 and round will work. In many of my cases, this was between 25 and 30.
-- IF the numbers are different, i.e. a few very large costs skew the average up but the median and mode are close, then I will use something
-- between the median and mode."
