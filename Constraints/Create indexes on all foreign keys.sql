-- Create indexes on all foreign keys
-- Part of the SQL Server DBA Toolbox at https://github.com/DavidSchanzer/Sql-Server-DBA-Toolbox
-- This script generates the CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX statement for every foreign key in a database.
-- This is useful for new databases that have foreign keys defined but no indexes as yet, as a starting point for index design.
