-- Find foreign keys and check constraints that are not trusted
-- Part of the SQL Server DBA Toolbox at https://github.com/DavidSchanzer/Sql-Server-DBA-Toolbox
-- This script lists the foreign key constraints that exist but are not trusted (ie. not enforced on existing data).
-- It's important to review these to ensure that this is deliberate (ie. the constraint cannot be trusted because the data may sometimes violate it).
