-- Find unused non-clustered indexes by checking Query Store
-- Part of the SQL Server DBA Toolbox at https://github.com/DavidSchanzer/Sql-Server-DBA-Toolbox
-- This script lists all non-clustered indexes, along with their DISABLE and DROP statements, that exist in the current database but aren't
-- found in either the Query Store or sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats (which lists index usage since last instance restart).
--
-- Note that THIS IS FOR THE CURRENT DATABASE ONLY.
--
-- If an index is not listed in either place, AND
--		the plans in the Query Store are at least 1 month old (value calculated below), AND
--		the instance hasn't been restarted for at least 1 week (value calculated below),
-- then we can be reasonably confident that an index can be initially disabled, and then later deleted.
