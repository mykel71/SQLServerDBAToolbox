-- Identifying large queries using Extended Events
-- Part of the SQL Server DBA Toolbox at https://github.com/DavidSchanzer/Sql-Server-DBA-Toolbox
-- This script creates an Extended Events session called "ExpensiveQueries" using the sql_batch_completed event where logical reads > 10000.
-- It includes SQL to summarise the collected data.
