-- Analyzing 'death by a thousand cuts' workloads
-- Part of the SQL Server DBA Toolbox at https://github.com/DavidSchanzer/Sql-Server-DBA-Toolbox
-- This script looks for top queries based on execution count, grouped by query_hash, to show both frequently executed stored procedures
-- and ad-hoc queries.
