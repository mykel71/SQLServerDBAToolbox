-- This script queries the transaction log and returns the number of rows that have been modified, inserted or deleted by the nominated SPID.
-- It’s worth noting that this script will return a the count of all rows that have been affected by the running transaction and not the
-- statement. If your transaction contains a number of statements, the count will be the total number of rows affected so far by all
-- statements that have run and are running.
